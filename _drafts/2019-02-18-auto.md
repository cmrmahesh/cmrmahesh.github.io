## Autos Usage in C++11

Auto keyword is probably one of the key words that staunchly uphold the [DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)principle. Here are the ways to use auto and best and worst case scenarios for it.

general syntax:
```
auto declarator initializer;
```

auto keyword initializes a variable based on the value it is initialized so one important point to note here is that variables are directly initialized. 
```
//wrong
auto b;
b = 8.0;

//correct
auto b = 9.0;
```
