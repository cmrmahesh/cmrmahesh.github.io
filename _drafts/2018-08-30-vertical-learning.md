## Vertical Learning

These days taking things for granted has becoming too common for us. Things that are available to us from the moment we wake up to the moment we sleep were all products of numerous people whose tinkering and curiosity has helped them to expand the adjacent possible knowingly or unknowingly. No its not true about what we read about innovations and idea they are not eureka moments but [slow hunches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugRZGDbPFU) developed over years. Sure Edison and Bell were geniuses no denying that but what we need to appreciate is that bulb and telephone didnt build the modern society , there are numerous inventions theories by pioneers that made .

How many times did we think of something and assumed if we could understand it worked form the groundup, the reason is irrelevant maybe you are paranoid about security, or just for fun, or to tinker remove and know what's inside it. The more we think about it we realize that current systems and companies heavily rely on abstarction to hide whatever they can whenver they can. Think of mobile phone 4-5 years ago you can remove battery and the case was removable and the present day flasgships are made to be broken(Lol)
