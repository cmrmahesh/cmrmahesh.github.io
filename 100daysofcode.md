### Day 0: Thursday, July 30, 2020

The [challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) website says to plan what you want to do the next 100 days and be clear of your goals. But frankly I felt lost and given an option to choose so I simply went through developer blogs reading what they did, why they did. The `imposter syndrome` is real. So in my pursuit of just starting with something and boosting my confidence I decided to take up easy challenges in leet code and finish as many as I can.
