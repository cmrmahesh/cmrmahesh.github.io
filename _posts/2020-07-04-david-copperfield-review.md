My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3425066669">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Poring over other reviews, I found huge praise for this book. <br /><br />There is a huge consensus that the book is filled with poetry and comedy. I donâ€™t know what I did wrong while reading, I felt neither of those. This book reminded me of "The adventures of tom sawyer" where I could not feel what it is praised for.<br /><br />Maybe next time..
