My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2248813090">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
My first book of Jeffery Archer was paths of glory. I loved the story and the way he carried the 'what-if ' factor. And I knew I would love this book. 
<br /><br />
Most of the stories has an O.Henry style written all over it. (remember The Gift of the Magi?). Some times the twist is obvious and some other times it felt unnecessary. (sorry!) Few stories didnâ€™t elicit any reaction from me, most felt easily predictable, But expecting a twist and that not having that materialised is a pleasant experience too.
<br /><br />
Stories are smooth-flowing, and has little to no bullshit and take the reader directly to the action-filled part.
<br /><br />
As with any good story, I enjoyed them all and had trouble putting down the book.
