title: Why?
---

I have been asking this same question over some time why I need to start a blog! Do I really need a blog? If I need what am I gonna fill it up with?

I love startups, operating systems, networks, politics and various other topics and more than that I love to talk on the topics that I love. I have an excess of mini-lectures backlogged in my memory that usually get wasted on my showerhead or unfortunate friends and passerby, but now, I make sure that this blog is the way to let out my frustration ( on you :p).

Enjoy Reading!!
