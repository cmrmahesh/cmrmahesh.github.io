## Hello

This page is for testing github pages and will be used for only that purpose.

2. Use **auto&** if you need a reference of the element. Changing the value will change the original vector.

```c++
    for(auto& i: vec){
    	std::cout << "from vec: " << i << endl;
    	i = 5;
    	std::cout << "modified as: " << i << endl;
    }
    //Now printing the original vector
    for (auto i: vec){
    	std::cout << i << endl;
    }
    //Will print all 5 now as we changed the value
```

That's it folks :simple_smile:
