Whatever are your opinions on building a company --a brand--, you should read this book. <br />Though this book has long been on my to-read list. A combination of Lockdown and a positive recommendation from a friend motivated me to start.{:text-justify}

SHOE DOG: The story of Phil Knight on his journey into building the company -- NIKE.

His decision to tour the world, before working on his <i>'Crazy Idea'</i> may seem outlandish but the way he used his learnings from that trip throughout his life is exemplary. He has shown the difference between the desire to lead a <i> 'different' </i> life and actually living one. He has a unique sense of life to be a game and his intentions to fill it with risks play as long as he can and if he can do it well.{:text-justify}

Starting on his idea and building his business, he goes on to explain how banking financial systems are not conducive to startup culture. Especially those that see rapid exponential growth. The book is filled with too many excruciating details on how each of his days is filled with too many problems of running the business. Doing everything he can in streamlining the company and staying afloat. The art of his negotiation is beautifully portrayed. Life is but negotiation with ourselves, we are all living it but this book made me feel it.{:text-justify}

Apart from the protagonist, he introduces us to a myriad number of people he came in contact with. The team that stayed with him, believed in his dream, and helped build the company. He didn't shy away in explaining the contributions made by his team. And how the team went beyond their ways in completing the task at hand. The importance of a strong team is aptly emphasized. For me, personally, I loved the team more than the lead, but that doesnâ€™t diminish his efforts or the hard work he put into his company.{:text-justify}

His ambition and hardworking in telling the story intact with facts and its spirit has paid it off. Though written as a thriller -- fast, engaging -- it is filled with the spirit of entrepreneurship, life lessons and all about team building and raising business, all tied together with a lot of curiosity and humor.{:text-justify}
