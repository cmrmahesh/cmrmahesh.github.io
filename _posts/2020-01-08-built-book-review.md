In 2020, I decided to write a review of (almost) every book I read. This is my first attempt, which is why I kept it very short.

I like the elegant telling on current infrastructure around us which is both same and different compared to past structures, highlighting the journey along the way. Hand sketches are a huge advantage for this genre. Felt author could have delved a little more into construction and structural analysis, but that's a personal opinion anyway.

I got good feedback from my friends on how I can improve my reviews. Moving on.
