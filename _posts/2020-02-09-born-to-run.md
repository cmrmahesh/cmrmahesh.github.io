This turned out to be one of my favourite book of the year.

Ever felt that you would love the book just by reading the title? I knew I would fall for born to run as soon as I heard about it.

That's when I decided to go old school about this book to buy a hard copy. Some may find it surprising that I took 3 months to finish off this book but I wanted to savor it, enjoy every line of it. The elevation you feel when he describes the Tarahumara not running but gliding along the mountain trails for days together with nothing but slippers under the feet and a smile on their faces is indescribable. Thatâ€™s when you feel you want to be a part of it, you want to fall in love with it. He has successfully managed to portray races into thrillers and with the number of races in this book, it is an absolute nail-biting ride.

"What I talk about when I talk about running" by Haruki Murakami has interested me in running but this book has pushed that interest to a whole new level. You don't need gel-filled shoes, you don't need music blasting through your ears, you don't need a watch to tell if you need to go fast or slow, you are born with everything you need to run. Running is solely about listening to your body. It's all about you and your body.

His storytelling and the flow of the book is impressive. As a result, there was no boring section in the entire book.

A must-read.
