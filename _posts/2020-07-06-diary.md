Its been one year. One year since I started writing a diary. My reasons for starting a diary, and for doing this almost every day are quite different. What started for one thing, blossomed into something more.

The reasons I started along this path were pretty simple.

- I have always felt that I forget memories faster than those I shared them with. So, it always felt awkward when they are discussing them and I wondered if I was even part of it.
- I wanted to write about something every day. Figuring out 'something' was a greater task than I imagined it to be. So the simplest answer was to write about my day.

I found much more compelling reasons to continue doing it. Putting down my thoughts on how I reacted has helped me see it from a different perspective. It turned out to be a therapeutic means to resolve emotional, social, and spiritual issues I face. Since I started journaling I became a firm believer of the quote :

>"Everything you need is already within you."

There are so many sources that go in great detail about how maintaining a journal helps in achieving your [goals](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/why-keeping-a-daily-journal-could-change-your-life-9a4c11f1a475), or it is great for helping you to be [self-aware](https://lifeskillsthatmatter.com/number-one-self-awareness-habit/). Sure maybe, they help you with all that what is important for me is it helps in processing my emotions, have a clearer picture of my past and present.

Oh, if you are convinced and want to start a journal I have a few pointers that can help you on this journey. Because these were the exact questions I faced when I started.

1. Going old-school or digital

    For me going digital was an obvious choice. I like the freedom that comes with it. But if you like writing a book, ensure it is well hidden.

2. Where to write.

    Now if you have decided to go digital, the question is where to write. My requirements were simple, it should have both mobile and desktop applications, 2FA, and encryption. I had three options, Evernote, OneNote, Notion.

    - Evernote was good but felt little bulky also their [mishap](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/16/evernote-u-turn/) not long ago made me move away from it.
    - [Notion](http://notion.so) was relatively new and was mainly focusing on business users, now it has grown leaps and bounds and is a very good choice. It has a little learning curve, but once accustomed it is a great tool.
    - OneNote is a great alternative too I particularly liked the Notebook -> Section -> Pages layout. No learning curve whatsoever.

    I am currently using OneNote and here is my example setup for the same:

    <figure class="align-center">
    <a href="#"><img src="{{ '/images/onenotesample.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt=""></a>

    </figure>

3. When to write.

    In the beginning, I used to earmark time before bed to write but as time went I wrote whenever I feel like. Having a mobile app helps here, I write down something as soon as some major event happens.

4. How/ What to write.

    If you are just writing what happened in your day, I feel you would find a lot to write about. But if you still struggle, remember no event is small or big, insignificant or important just put down everything.

    At some point, I started writing what happened and how I felt about it emotionally. Honestly being truthful to yourself was tougher than I expected, but slowly I caught on. Going with the flow is the key, lay bare your emotions.

Skipping a day is fine but ensure you are not skipping more than 2 days in a row. It's fine to feel like not writing, just a line or two also helps.

Somedays my entry goes like:

"Woke up late. I hate everything. Sleeping."

Since this diary is you and your inner sanctum ensure it is well protected. Logout of all unnecessary devices, update your passwords regularly, set up 2FA, and lock the app on devices.

My diary has become a disinterested companion that I share everything, good, bad, and the ugly. Hope it becomes for you too.
