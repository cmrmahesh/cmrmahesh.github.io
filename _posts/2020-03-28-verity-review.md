My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3247488307">4 of 5 stars</a>

One of the best initial hooks/introductions I have ever seen.

The story is both creepy and unputdownable.
Little hard to guess the climax but the twist, in the end, is unexpected. 
A good read if you are looking for a thriller.
