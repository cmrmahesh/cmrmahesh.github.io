My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3089491401">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A simple storyline, but a beautiful narration. There a no highs or lows in the storyline, and it's bland. Categorized as a children's book, the very few illustrations available are not of much help. Finally a little disappointing ending.
