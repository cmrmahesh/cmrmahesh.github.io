[Hourly History](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15427604.Hourly_History){:target="\_blank"} work always seemed intresting to me. I feel they are doing a good job bringing the introductions of major historical events easily accessible. I got a chance to get a copy when I was trying amzon kindle unlimited.

Here's my review on [The Renaissance: A History From Beginning to End (Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Theresa of Avila, William Shakespeare, Martin Luther, Johannes Gutenberg) ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30336653-the-renaissance){:target="\_blank"}

This book is not as comprehensive as its title says. There is no cause and effect relationship explanation. The only correlation I could take out from this entire book is that the development of the printing press and failure of the religious institutions ushered Renaissance, and that's about it.

But it serves its purpose as a general introduction to major personalities and developments in religion, art, music, and technology across Europe.

I loved the beautiful portrayal on the essence of the Renaissance.
