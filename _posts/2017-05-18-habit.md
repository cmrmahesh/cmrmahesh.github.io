This blog has been silent for too long or was I? Any one who fairly knows me that I am not!

Its hard to make a new habit! The earlier I accept it the better. I love this quote by Aristotle.

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but an habit.

I am now trying out a lot of things and blogging is one of them. While wondering what I can write everyday (or atleast regularly), I was inspired by charlie (from perks of being a wallflower) to write about books I read. Reading books was an age old habit of mine not a heavy reader though but kindle(thanks to my bro!) has surely piqued my interest and love for books. And recently found a partner Arjav Patel who helps me in motivating myself to read more. Kudos to you bro. Keep inspiring!

So here I go starting a new habit! Godspeed.
