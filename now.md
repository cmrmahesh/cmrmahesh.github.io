- I am currently enjoying the lockdown and quarantined life at my native place with my family.
- Though the heat is extreme here (it reaches upto 42<sup>0</sup>C), I am grateful that I get to eat well cooked home-made food.

Purpose of this page:
> "It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. A public declaration of priorities."

This is inspired from [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/)

I intend not to put this /now page on the main navigation bar (yet!). See the end note.

## My Impossible-List

Bucket lists are good but as we tumble along in life these bucketlists lose prominence. We get so comfy in our routines, we lose sight of things to do. Difference between a bucket list and `impossible list` is best explained by [Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/about/joel/){make sure you read his story! inspiring}, who created the world’s first impossible list and defined the [difference](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/) between it and a regular bucket list.
TLDR: Impossible list evolving.
